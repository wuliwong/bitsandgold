== Bits and Gold

I made this open source b/c my friend suggested it. The site is up and running at http://bitsandgold.com

The site is to be a tool for finance (and maybe news and maybe more???) for people who prefer to price things in non-fiat currencies like gold, silver and bitcoins.

Fork away, pls.
